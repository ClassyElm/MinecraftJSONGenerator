# Weekly Reflection Statements

## Week 1

1/19/2021

Time Spent: ~3 hours

This week, I started out by completing the initial setup for the class. With no major hiccups in that process, I was all
set to continue with exercise 1. As for the indie project, I was not quite certain if I wanted to make a JSON generator
since I have made a couple already in the past. Another option I had been considering was making an online multiplayer
crossword puzzle web application (for my grandparents). Aside from that, however, my first week back to class was not
extremely productive as a result of the long (but appreciated) winter break.

## Week 2

1/25/2021

Time Spent: ~10 hours

Once again, I felt a little sluggish getting started with this week's assignments and lectures. A plus, however, is that
I finally decided upon making (another) JSON generator for Minecraft. This time I hope to improve the UI and provide
more features for saving, loading, importing, and exporting Minecraft commands. I also completed the activities (both
in-class and out-of-class) and set up this GitHub repository for the JSON generator indie project. Finally, I completed
exercise 2 and familiarized myself with some features (including the debugger) of IntelliJ IDEA.

While researching JSON generators, I found the following related to (but not quite exactly) what I want to make:
- [Tellraw Generator for Minecraft](https://minecraftjson.com/) (*This is most similar in functionality*)
- [Minecraft Custom Sign Generator](https://minecraft.tools/en/sign.php)

## Week 3

2/1/2021

Time Spent: ~13 hours

This week, I had better motivation going into the activities and demos for the week. On Tuesday, I completed the Log4J
intro and application to exercise 2 (last week's exercise). I also completed the JUnit activity and applied it to
exercise 2. This week, I did little with my indie project aside from keeping track of what time I spent working with the
class assignments. Finally, I completed exercise 3 (inverse captcha exercise) and learned a bit more about JUnit and
Log4J. Aside from that, this week was not particularly busy for me.

## Week 4

2/8/2021

Time Spent: TBD

This week, I started out by completing the requirements for the indie project checkpoint 1 (including creating this
reflection log). I completed the wireframe images using [figma](https://figma.com/) and created the screenDesign.md
culmination of the wireframes. I also created the user stories for the project as well as the application flow document.
To finish up the project 1 check point requirements that I was missing, I created the project plan document, which
describes weekly tasks completed for the indie project.

I also completed the project checkpoint 1 review and discussed the state of my project. After reviewing, I fixed the
MVP user stories and added a couple that were missing. Also, I added the wireframe dialogue for saving commands. On top
of that, I fixed the project plan to show a **plan** of what tasks I will develop for the project and when
(who would've guessed that a plan lists your plan?)

On Wednesday, I did a lot, but a lot did not happen. I completed exercise 4 after several issues with setting up SSH
authentication instead of HTTPS authentication for GitHub. Also, my VM began freezing up a lot and had to be hard-reset
a few times. This ultimately caused it to lose internet connection (must have gotten corrupted). Fortunately, I had a
backup copy and loaded that up with minimal work required. However, then I ran into dependency issues with IntelliJ and
Maven, only for it to turn out to be related to a Hibernate facet. After all the trouble, I was able to submit a working
version of exercise 4. At least now I know what to expect for implementing Hibernate into my indie project.
