# Weekly Reflection Statements

## Week 1

1/19/2021

Time Spent: ~3 hours

This week, I started out by completing the initial setup for the class. With no major hiccups in that process, I was all
set to continue with exercise 1. As for the indie project, I was not quite certain if I wanted to make a JSON generator
since I have made a couple already in the past. Another option I had been considering was making an online multiplayer
crossword puzzle web application (for my grandparents). Aside from that, however, my first week back to class was not
extremely productive as a result of the long (but appreciated) winter break.

## Week 2

1/25/2021

Time Spent: ~10 hours

Once again, I felt a little sluggish getting started with this week's assignments and lectures. A plus, however, is that
I finally decided upon making (another) JSON generator for Minecraft. This time I hope to improve the UI and provide
more features for saving, loading, importing, and exporting Minecraft commands. I also completed the activities (both
in-class and out-of-class) and set up this GitHub repository for the JSON generator indie project. Finally, I completed
exercise 2 and familiarized myself with some features (including the debugger) of IntelliJ IDEA.

While researching JSON generators, I found the following related to (but not quite exactly) what I want to make:
- [Tellraw Generator for Minecraft](https://minecraftjson.com/) (*This is most similar in functionality*)
- [Minecraft Custom Sign Generator](https://minecraft.tools/en/sign.php)

## Week 3

2/1/2021

Time Spent: ~13 hours

This week, I had better motivation going into the activities and demos for the week. On Tuesday, I completed the Log4J
intro and application to exercise 2 (last week's exercise). I also completed the JUnit activity and applied it to
exercise 2. This week, I did little with my indie project aside from keeping track of what time I spent working with the
class assignments. Finally, I completed exercise 3 (inverse captcha exercise) and learned a bit more about JUnit and
Log4J. Aside from that, this week was not particularly busy for me.

## Week 4

2/8/2021

Time Spent: TBD

This week, I started out by completing the requirements for the indie project checkpoint 1 (including creating this
reflection log).
